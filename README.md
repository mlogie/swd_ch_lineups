# swd_ch_lineups
You need to clone this repository to your working directory:
https://github.com/fafranco82/swdestinydb-json-data
Then download my script.
You'll need to edit line 7 of my script to the loaction of the 'set' folder from the swdb repository.
You can edit the scoring system from line 19.
You can edit the modifier downgrade value in line 24 (e.g a +2 Ranged is worth 0.7 times the value of a 2 Ranged base side)
You might want to also edit line 27 and choose which sets you want to build with.  These use the swdb abbreviations:
AW, SoR, EaW, TPG, LEG, WotF, RIV, AtG, AoN, CONV, SoH, CM, TR
