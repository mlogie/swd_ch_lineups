You'll need to edit line 7 of my script to the loaction of the 'set' folder from the swdb repository.<br>
You can edit the scoring system from line 19.<br>
You can edit the modifier downgrade value in line 24 (e.g a +2 Ranged is worth 0.7 times the value of a 2 Ranged base side)<br>
You might want to also edit line 27 and choose which sets you want to build with.  These use the swdb abbreviations:<br>
AW, SoR, EaW, TPG, LEG, WotF, RIV, AtG, AoN, CONV, SoH, CM, TR<br>
Just message me if you have trouble.
